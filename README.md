# Flight Data Exploration 2008

# DataSet
Flight Dataset of the year 2008, contains various columns about delays and cancellation of the flights.
Data Source: https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009

# Summary of Findings<br>
In my exploration, I focused on Arrival and Departual Times, Cancellation and Delay Reasons.
I fuond that the mosst reason of Cancellation is Weather, and most of flights not cancelled. 
The Arrival and Departure Delay distribution is right skewed. Also, There is a positive correlation between Arrival and Departure Delay.
Security Delay has a weak relation vs other delays. There is a strong relation Arrival delay and departure delay. 
Weather Delay has a significant impact on Arrival and Departure Delays.

# Key Insights for Presentation
